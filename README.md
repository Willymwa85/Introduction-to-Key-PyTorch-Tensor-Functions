# Introduction-to-Key-PyTorch-Tensor-Functions
 - torch.zeros_like() - Initializes a tensor with zeros based on shape of input tensor. Useful for clearing tensor values and parameter initialization.
torch.normal() - Generates random numbers from a normal distribution. Commonly used for weight initialization in neural networks.
torch.hstack() - Stacks sequence of tensors horizontally by concatenating along a new axis. Helps combine data for models.
torch.gather() - Gathers values from a tensor along a given dimension based on index tensor. Enables slicing and filtering tensors.
torch.sqrt() - Calculates element-wise square root of input tensor. Useful for normalization and scaling.
Through examples, we explored how these functions help with initialization, random data generation, combining tensors, indexing and math operations.

Some suggestions for next steps:

Experiment with these functions by applying them on sample data for your models
Explore other PyTorch tensor functions like stack, cat, masked_select etc.
Learn about PyTorch modules like nn, optim for building neural networks
Work through PyTorch autograd, loss functions and optimization
Build a small end-to-end model with PyTorch using the covered concepts
The tensor functions provide the basic building blocks. Next it would be useful to learn how PyTorch supports building and training neural networks.
